# This is my first data cleaning project where I worked on a raw CSV file and cleaned it using pandas.

What I Did:
Removed unnecessary columns like "Peak" and "All Time Peak".

Cleaned messy text data in columns like "Actual gross" and "Tour title" using regex to remove brackets, symbols, and extra characters.

Cleaned and converted "Ref." column by:

Stripping brackets and removing alphabets.

Filling missing values using linear interpolation.

Converting it into proper integer type.

Output:
The cleaned dataset is saved as:
cleaned_my_file (1).csv
